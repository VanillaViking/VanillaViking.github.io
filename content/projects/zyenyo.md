Talk about spontaneous plans.

Feeling dissatisfied with an existing type-test bot, one day my friend Seizoxu casually commented that it would be interesting to build our own, with all the features we desired. It was a lazy Saturday afternoon; I was hardly going through the motions, yet, something *really* clicked with that idea.

Before Zyenyo, me and Sei would perform dozens of typing tests whenever we had time to spare, on a discord bot called *Nadeko*. While it served our purposes decently, there was potential for much more. Nadeko is an all-purpose bot that has thousands of other functions and features. In fact, the first slogan you see when you open up it's website is: **"One discord bot to replace a ton."** This typing test command was- well, *miscellaneous*.

On that same day, I feel like we both realised that this would be the perfect project for us to collaborate on. The problem was basically defined for us: create a specialised discord typing-test bot. And since we are also the end users, we have a pretty clear idea if we are doing a good job or not.

As we began developing, the project naturally took on the philosophy of **"Doing one thing and doing it well"**, unintentionally also the polar opposite of Nadeko. The initial versions were very close to the way Nadeko functioned, since we liked the easily startable typing tests. Once we started adding in functionality such as typing statistics, teams, Typing Points (**TP**) and more, Zyenyo started to take it's own shape and we are still actively bringing improvements to it!
