this was a pretty cool tourney concept, it didnt hit me how much the playerbase has improved in 5 years until now. The early stage mappools atleast would nowadays be considered easy even for a low 5 digit rank locked tourney. 

It was a struggle to actually play though, since our team was short-handed for every match we play. We managed to make it past groups despite that which was cool. Fun tourney except for the scheduling hell
