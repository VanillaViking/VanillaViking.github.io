I'm still not sure how I won this one lol. Qualifiers went decent, I got third seed behind cyan and potla. Rest of the tournament went okay up until I faced Cyan in semi finals, who had just come off of beating poke on TB. I already knew I would have to start grinding the pools like it was grandfinals early. I was able to play with minimal nerves cause of all the practice, and, with a lot of luck, ended up taking the match on TB. I then went on to face potla in the finals, who was having a case of diahrea :sadge: so I took it 6-2. At this point I think I was practicing not to win, but so that I didn't regret NOT practicing lol. Cyan won the loser bracket match and it was me vs cyan for grand finals. The match started off neck and neck, both of us winning our picks 2-2. I think I managed to get a break point on hr1 and took hr4 right after as well. Cyan responded with a break point of his own and the match was tied at 5-5. I think I picked the fingercontrol nomod next because I had good scores on it compared to cyans score in LB match. I managed to take that and hr2, and I was one away from winning. Cyan picked nm3 and went absolutely godmode, fcing the entire map. 6-5. I ended up gambling everything on low ar hd LMAO. With all the luck in the universe I managed to win that, taking the tournament. I still dont understand.
