This one was pretty wild. Lost to cyan in groups, lost to Potla (this man destroyed me on god damn hdhr on TB). Then in lb won against nitr0f on TB (scary man). And then neil simply rekt me 5-0 XD. Honestly i didnt expect to get swept but I fully deserved it... kinda slacked off during this stage of the tourney. Still had fun regardless so yeah.
