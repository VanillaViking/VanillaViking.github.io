Ahhh first tourney. I think this really revived my interest in osu!, I improved rapidly just within the timespan of the tourney. Also met majority of the osu India community at this time which also contributed to spiking my interest. Did not at all expect to place so high though, I think I got pretty lucky as players like cyan and Potla werent playing in the tourney, as well as a bit of luck in peefman48's match (dont ask me why I decided to play at 2am).
