This one was a real test of will power and time management. I was busy with full time work as well as uni, and ended up struggling to find time to practice the pools. Regardless, was still fun as always to compete with some of the best players in India.

The tourney itself went pretty smooth for me up until SF, where I faced [_Cyan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10250612/osu). The picks were just going back and forth for the entire match, and at no point did the point lead exceed 2. The tie breaker really topped this match of, being USAO's ultimate mega mix, relentless EDM drops and bangers for 5 minutes. I ended up narrowly taking TB and advancing to the finals where I faced poke([ArtoriaMyAngel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11412507)).

Poke was simply unstoppable this entire tourney. He's shaping up to be the best tournament player in India, there was almost no question that I would be losing this matchup, especially considering that my skillset is not well equipped to take points off him. He ended up winning 7-1, and also went on to win the entire tourney, earning himself 16800 INR as well as his very first OIWT badge! Major congratulations to him, I wouldn't say anyone deserved it more.
