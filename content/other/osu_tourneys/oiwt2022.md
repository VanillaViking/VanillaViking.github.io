Looking back at this one im actually pretty happy with how I performed. was on roadtrip for a week right after qualifiers and another week long trip right before semi finals. despite that, I managed to win against Hakamora on tb and lost to Cyan on tb after going down 5-0.

Next I faced poke in the loser's bracket and I dont have an excuse here, he simply played much better than me :P. Overall, it was fun and I'm satisfied with a top 3 finish.
