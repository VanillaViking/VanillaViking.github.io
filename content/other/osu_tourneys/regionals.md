Not sure if this is even listed in the correct order but watever this was a pretty fun tourney. Teams were created by grouping Indian players into North, East, South and West based on where in india they live/originate. I think it was me, Arulson, Speshimen, xav, naoey, and retsu for team south (almost everyone from bangalore kekw). we managed to beat out one of the teams and actually had a chance of making it to the finals, but Xav's power went out and I was forced to play hr LMAo. I dont remember much else but it was very fun i would love to participate again
