pretty cool got to team up with some gamers Saturas, Clutchx, Endrobrine for this one. 

This was during the time I was using a keyboard which was having some weird latency issues, making it very hard to maintain my accuracy. I atleast didn't fall too far behind; could still be a contributing factor to the team, but it sucks to know that I couldn't give it my best.
